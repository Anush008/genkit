# Genkit with Next.js (Experimental)

If you are starting from scratch, craete a new next.js project by running:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Make sure to say `Yes` to TypeScript as you language of choice.

Then initialize Genkit in your Next.js project folder.

```bash
genkit init
```

Make sure to select `Next.js (Experimental)` option for platform and say yes to generating a sample flow. This will create a `src/app/genkit.ts` (or `app/genkit.ts` if you chose not use `src`) file  in your source folder. This file contains your Genkit configuration and sample flows.
